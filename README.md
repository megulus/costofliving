# Overview

My idea with this project is to help people understand the true costs of their housing choices.

In making housing choices, often the information is not available to help people look beyond the mortgage, HOA fees, and taxes/insurance. If people look into commuting, they often consider the commute time, but not the cost. Utility costs are also rarely considered.

Furthermore, most buyers do not consider the externalities of their housing choices. All of our housing choices impact the environment and government coffers in some way, but not all of our choices have equal impact. For example, a house far from the urban core in a low-density area can actually require greater subsidy than one in a more densely populated, central neighborhood. Roads cost a certain amount per square foot, but when that road is laid in a compact, dense area, there are more taxpayers served per square foot of road (if that makes sense). There is more taxpayer subsidy per capita for infrastructure in the lower-density, farther-out areas.

Ultimately, I'd like to build a program that, given a location and housing type, can give the user information about:
* monthly mortgage payments and common charges (if applicable)
* taxes and insurance
* commute time
* estimated annual commute cost (by mode)
* estimated annual utility costs
* estimated carbon footprint
* comparative (estimated) carbon footprint of two address
* infrastructure cost per capita (roads, utilities) to serve a location

The program isn't meant to advocate one type of housing over another; the goal is to give people a tool to make an informed decision.
